# An array is an ordered list of objects.
# We often use the word "elements" to describe the items inside the array. 
# The array itself is an object. 
# # Think of a box in the real world. 
# A box can hold multiple items inside of it.
# The box is an object and the items inside of it are objects as well. 
# 

 numbers = [4 , 6, 8, 10, 12 ,14] # this is how we define arrays
 p numbers

 things=["Haris","lahore","Staunch"] # we can alse create array of strings, bool characters, or mix of all
 p things

 details=["Haris","22","Lahore","Staunch",true,10.02]
 p details 

 # For arrays we will be using p methods
 # becuase puts brwka it in a line character and p displays in form of an array,
