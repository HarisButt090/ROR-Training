1. Advanced Math Sentence
Declare two variables a and b. Perform addition, multiplication, and division, and construct a sentence that describes each operation within a single string using interpolation.
2. Dynamic Story
Create variables hero, villain, and location. Use interpolation to tell a short story about how the hero defeats the villain at the location.
3. Date and Time Formatting
Using Rubyâ€™s Time.now, display the current date and time in the format: "Today is [weekday], [month] [day], [year] at [hour]:[minute]:[second]."
