# Define a same_first_and_last_letter method that accepts a string. 
# The method should return true if the first and last character are equal, 
# and false otherwise.
# Assume the string will always have 1 or more characters.
#
# Examples:
# The => indicates the expected return value
#
# same_first_and_last_letter("runner")   => true
# same_first_and_last_letter("Runner")   => false
# same_first_and_last_letter("clock")    => false
# same_first_and_last_letter("q")        => true

  else

  end
end

# Define a three_number_sum method that accepts a 3-character string.
# The method should calculate the sum of the digits of the string. 
# HINT: Youâ€™ll have to figure out a way to convert the
# string-ified digits to integers.
#
# Examples:
# The => indicates the expected return value
#
# three_number_sum("123")   => 6
# three_number_sum("567")   => 18
# three_number_sum("444")   => 12
# three_number_sum("000")   => 0

  else
    "Should be only three numbered string"
  end 
end

puts three_number_sum("567") # each character will be converted to integer and will return sum of 18
